You push your local repository to the remote repository using the git push
command after first establishing a relationship between the two with the git
remote add [alias] [url] command. If you visit your Github repository, it will
show you the URL to use for pushing. You'll first enter something like:

git remote add origin git@github.com:username/reponame.git

Unless you started by running git clone against the remote repository, in which
case this step has been done for you already.

And after that, you'll type:

git push origin master

After your first push, you can simply type:

git push

when you want to update the remote repository in the future.
